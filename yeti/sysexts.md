# System Extensions (Sysexts)

## Overview

Sysexts are overlay images that extend the immutable base OS by adding files under `/usr`. They are distributed as EROFS images and managed by systemd-sysext at runtime and systemd-sysupdate for downloads.

## Constraints

1. **Only `/usr`** — Sysexts can only provide files under `/usr`. They cannot directly modify `/etc` or `/var`.
2. **Config injection** — Configs needed in `/etc` must be:
   - Captured to `/usr/share/factory/etc/` during the sysext build (via mkosi.finalize)
   - Injected at boot via systemd-tmpfiles rules in `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/`
   - Capture ONLY the specific paths the tmpfiles rules reference — never all of `/etc`. The buildroot `/etc` is the merged base view, so a full capture leaks `/etc/shadow` and SSH host keys into the published sysext (frostyard/snosi#282)
3. **Overlay composition** — All sysexts overlay the same base `/usr`, so file conflicts between sysexts must be avoided.

## Sysext Configuration Pattern

Every sysext mkosi.conf follows the same structure:

```ini
[Config]
Dependencies=base

[Output]
ImageId=<sysext-name>
Output=<sysext-name>
Overlay=yes
ManifestFormat=json
Format=sysext

[Content]
Bootable=no
BaseTrees=%O/base
PostOutputScripts=%D/shared/sysext/postoutput/sysext-postoutput.sh
FinalizeScripts=%D/shared/sysext/finalize/sysext-required-paths.sh,%D/shared/sysext/finalize/sysext-strip-icon-cache.sh

Packages=<package-list>

[Build]
Environment=KEYPACKAGE=<package-name>
```

Key settings:
- `Dependencies=base` — Requires the base image to be built first
- `Overlay=yes` — This is an overlay on the base image
- `BaseTrees=%O/base` — Uses the base image output as the filesystem base
- `Format=sysext` — Outputs an EROFS sysext image
- `KEYPACKAGE` — The package whose version determines the sysext version

Every sysext must also have a `mkosi.images/<name>/required-paths.txt`: one
absolute path per line (comments with `#`) that must exist in the finished
buildroot. The shared finalize script
(`shared/sysext/finalize/sysext-required-paths.sh`) fails the build if any is
missing. This guards against publishing structurally broken images: the
2026-07-01 incus sysext (`1+7.2-debian13-202607011055`) shipped without any
`incus-base`/`incus-client` payload (no `incusd`, no CLI, no units) and
nothing in the pipeline noticed. List the KEYPACKAGE's main binaries, the
payload of load-bearing dependency packages, the primary unit files, and the
`multi-user.target.d/10-<name>.conf` activation drop-in. mkosi runs the shared
check in addition to (after) the image's own `mkosi.finalize` — file-detected
default scripts compose with explicit `FinalizeScripts=` entries.

**Delta semantics:** for `Overlay=yes` images the finalize `$BUILDROOT` is the
sysext DELTA (the overlay upper layer — exactly what ships), not the merged
base view. Only list paths the sysext itself provides. A package that is also
in the base image (e.g. `wget`, `gcc`, `make`, `automake`) is "already
installed" at build time, contributes nothing to the delta, and its paths will
always fail the check even though they exist at runtime — caught live when
`wget` in debdev's list failed CI on the first run.

`code-server`, `edge`, `bitwarden`, and `azurevpn` are the current exceptions to the `Packages=` line: it downloads a pinned upstream `.deb` in `mkosi.images/code-server/mkosi.postinst.chroot` with `verified_download()` and installs it with `dpkg -i`. It still sets `KEYPACKAGE=code-server`, and the shared postoutput script resolves that version from the merged dpkg database. `edge` does the same via the shared `shared/packages/edge/mkosi.postinst.d/edge.chroot` (pinned Edge .deb, postinst repo hooks stripped, `/opt/microsoft/msedge` relocated to `/usr/lib/microsoft-edge`, product logos symlinked into hicolor); its runtime dependency list comes from `Include=%D/shared/packages/edge/mkosi.conf`, shared with the loaded profiles so the two never drift. `bitwarden` follows the same shape (`shared/packages/bitwarden/`): pinned .deb, `/opt/Bitwarden` relocated to `/usr/lib/Bitwarden`, SUID `chrome-sandbox`, desktop-file Exec rewrite, deps via `Include=`.

## Sysext-Specific Extra Files

Some sysexts include extra files via `mkosi.extra/`:

### azurevpn
- No `mkosi.extra/` — reuses `shared/packages/azurevpn/` (fragment + postinst) verbatim from the loaded profiles
- Ships `cap_net_admin` as a real file capability: erofs preserves `security.capability`, so the sysext deliberately does NOT carry the loaded profiles' `microsoft-azurevpn-workaround.service` (that service exists only because the OCI image packaging path drops caps)
- Desktop entry uses an absolute-path `Icon=` — no icon theme/cache involvement
- The postinst purges `patchelf` after the rpath fixes so the build tool ships nowhere

### bitwarden
- No `mkosi.extra/` — everything comes from the shared package fragment and postinst script (`shared/packages/bitwarden/`), reused verbatim from the loaded profiles
- Desktop app with no systemd service: no preset, no `Upholds=` drop-in
- Ships hicolor icons — depends on the no-icon-cache pattern (see Desktop Applications in Sysexts below)

### code-server
- `mkosi.postinst.chroot` — Downloads code-server .deb via `verified_download()`, installs with `dpkg -i`. Upstream package targets `/usr/lib/code-server` with `/usr/bin/code-server` symlink and systemd units under `/usr/lib/systemd/`, so no relocation is required.

### debdev / dev
- `mkosi.postinst.chroot` — Repoints `/usr/bin`+`/usr/sbin` symlinks that route through `/etc/alternatives` to their resolved targets. Sysexts cannot ship `/etc`, so alternatives symlinks created while installing these sysexts' packages would dangle at runtime (observed live: `/usr/bin/automake -> /etc/alternatives/automake`, missing).

### docker
- `usr/lib/systemd/system-preset/20-docker.preset` — Enable docker.socket + containerd (numbered below 30 so it beats the base image's `30-docker.preset` disable; presets are first-match-wins in lexical order)
- `usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.d/10-docker.conf` — `Upholds=docker.socket containerd.service` drop-in for reliable boot activation (the socket, not docker.service — dockerd runs `-H fd://` and fails without socket-passed FDs)
- `mkosi.finalize` — Captures `/etc/default/docker`, `/etc/docker`, `/etc/containerd` to factory defaults
- `usr/lib/sysusers.d/docker.conf` — Docker user/group definitions
- `usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/docker.conf` — Factory config injection

### edge
- No `mkosi.extra/` — everything comes from the shared package fragment and postinst script (`shared/packages/edge/`), reused verbatim from the loaded profiles
- Desktop app with no systemd service: no preset, no `Upholds=` drop-in
- Its icons are hicolor symlinks created by the relocation script — visibility depends on the no-icon-cache pattern (see Desktop Applications in Sysexts below), so on images that still ship `icon-theme.cache` the Edge icon renders generic

### incus
- `mkosi.finalize` — Captures the tmpfiles-referenced `/etc` paths to factory defaults
- `usr/lib/systemd/system-preset/40-incus.preset` — Enable incus services
- `usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.d/10-incus.conf` — `Upholds=` drop-in for reliable boot activation (sockets + lxcfs + startup + sysext-setup; incus.service itself is socket-activated)
- `usr/lib/systemd/system/incus-sysext-setup.service` — Oneshot post-merge setup (subuid/subgid)
- `usr/lib/incus/incus-sysext-setup` — The setup script the service runs
- `usr/lib/sysusers.d/{dnsmasq,rdma}.conf` — User/group definitions
- `usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/incus.conf` — Factory config injection + runtime dirs + xz alternatives links

### nix
- `mkosi.finalize` — Captures `/etc/nix` to factory defaults
- `usr/lib/systemd/system/nix.mount` + `nix-daemon.service.d/mount-binding.conf` — `/nix` bind mount wiring
- `usr/lib/systemd/system-preset/40-nix.preset` — Enable nix.mount + nix-daemon
- `usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.d/10-nix.conf` — `Upholds=nix.mount nix-daemon.socket nix-daemon.service` drop-in for reliable boot activation
- `usr/lib/sysusers.d/nix.conf` — Nix user/group
- `usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/nix.conf` — `/nix` hierarchy + factory config injection

### tailscale
- `mkosi.finalize` — Captures `/etc/default/tailscaled` to factory defaults (tailscaled requires the EnvironmentFile)
- `usr/lib/systemd/system-preset/40-tailscale.preset` — Enable tailscaled
- `usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.d/10-tailscale.conf` — `Upholds=tailscaled.service` drop-in for reliable boot activation
- `usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tailscale.conf` — Factory config injection

### vscode
- No `mkosi.extra/` — the Microsoft `code` deb installs natively under `/usr` (`/usr/share/code` + `/usr/bin/code` symlink), so no relocation is needed
- Reuses `shared/packages/vscode/mkosi.postinst.d/vscode.chroot` (the same script the loaded profiles run) to add `inode/directory` to code.desktop's MimeType
- Desktop app with no systemd service: no preset, no `Upholds=` drop-in; the deliverables are the `.desktop` entry and icon (see Desktop Applications in Sysexts below)

## Version Extraction and Naming

The shared postoutput script (`shared/sysext/postoutput/sysext-postoutput.sh`) handles versioning:

1. Reads `KEYPACKAGE` from environment
2. Queries the manifest JSON for the key package's version
3. Handles Debian epoch notation: `5:1.2.3` → `5+1.2.3`
4. Appends `+r{SYSEXT_REVISION}` when `SYSEXT_REVISION` is set in the image's
   `[Build] Environment` (see below)
5. Maps Debian release to VERSION_ID: forky → 14, trixie → 13, bookworm → 12, bullseye → 11, buster → 10
6. Renames the output image: `{IMAGE_ID}_{KEYVERSION}_{OS_VERSION}_{ARCH}.{ext}` (ext may be `raw`, `raw.gz`, `raw.xz`, etc.)
   - Example: `docker_5+29.3.0_13_x86-64.raw`
7. Annotates manifest with `.config.key_package` and `.config.key_version`
8. Creates unversioned symlink for systemd-sysupdate MatchPattern

### SYSEXT_REVISION: republishing content fixes

Publishing (`build.yml` → repogen publish-to-r2) uses `skip-duplicates: true`
keyed on the versioned filename, so a sysext whose KEYPACKAGE version has not
changed is never re-uploaded — tree fixes (presets, drop-ins, tmpfiles,
factory captures) silently do not reach users until the upstream package
version bumps. Concrete case: the `multi-user.target.d` Upholds drop-ins
(52b2bfb, 2026-07-01) landed after the last incus publish, and the nix sysext
had not republished since 2026-03 because `nix-setup-systemd` never bumps.

To force a republish, set `Environment=SYSEXT_REVISION=N` in the sysext's
`[Build]` section. The postoutput script appends `+rN` to the version, which
systemd-sysupdate and dpkg both order strictly newer than the bare version,
while a later KEYPACKAGE version still dominates. Bump `N` for further fixes
at the same package version; remove the setting once the package version
moves on its own.

## Sysupdate Registration

Each sysext distributed to users needs two files in the base image at `mkosi.images/base/mkosi.extra/usr/lib/sysupdate.d/`:

> Note: a sysext built and published from a separate repository still needs its
> sysupdate wiring registered in the base image (every sysext distributed via
> repository.frostyard.org does). emdash was registered this way until 2026-07-07,
> when it was retired.

### Transfer file (`<name>.transfer`)

Defines how systemd-sysupdate downloads the sysext:

```ini
[Transfer]
Features=<name>
Verify=false

[Source]
Type=url-file
Path=https://repository.frostyard.org/ext/<name>/
MatchPattern=<name>_@v_%w_%a.raw.zst \
             <name>_@v_%w_%a.raw.xz \
             <name>_@v_%w_%a.raw.gz \
             <name>_@v_%w_%a.raw

[Target]
Type=regular-file
Path=/var/lib/extensions.d/
MatchPattern=<name>_@v_%w_%a.raw.zst \
             <name>_@v_%w_%a.raw.xz \
             <name>_@v_%w_%a.raw.gz \
             <name>_@v_%w_%a.raw
CurrentSymlink=<name>.raw
```

### Feature file (`<name>.feature`)

Provides metadata and defaults:

```ini
[Feature]
Description=<description>
Documentation=<url>
Enabled=false
```

All sysexts default to `Enabled=false` — users opt in via systemd-sysupdate configuration. Externally-built sysexts may be registered here too, so do not infer the root `mkosi.conf` dependency list from the sysupdate directory alone.

## Service Activation Pattern (Upholds=)

**Do not rely on `WantedBy=multi-user.target` + preset alone for sysext-provided services.** This combination breaks at boot because:

1. PID 1 scans unit files before the sysext is merged — `tailscaled.service` doesn't exist yet
2. The `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/` symlink points to a missing file and is silently dropped
3. After `reload-sysext.service` merges the overlay and runs `daemon-reload`, the previously-dropped `Wants=` is not re-triggered

**Required pattern:** Ship a `multi-user.target.d/10-<name>.conf` drop-in **inside the sysext** with:

```ini
[Unit]
Upholds=<name>.service
```

This drop-in is brand-new to systemd after the post-merge `daemon-reload`, so it is processed cleanly when `multi-user.target` activates. `Upholds=` also provides crash-restart behavior — if the service dies, systemd will restart it.

Example path inside the sysext: `usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.d/10-tailscale.conf`

The preset (`40-<name>.preset`) is still required to set the enabled state; the drop-in handles the activation timing.

## Runtime Setup Service Pattern

Some sysexts need to modify files that already exist in the base image (e.g., `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, PAM configs). The tmpfiles `C` (copy-if-absent) directive cannot overwrite existing files, so a runtime setup service is needed instead.

**Pattern** (used by incus):
1. Create an idempotent setup script at `usr/lib/<name>/<name>-sysext-setup` that patches the target files (e.g., adds NSS modules to nsswitch.conf, configures PAM stacks)
2. Create a oneshot systemd service (`<name>-sysext-setup.service`) that runs the script at boot
3. Enable via preset (`40-<name>.preset`)

The setup script must be idempotent — safe to run on every boot without accumulating duplicate entries.

## Desktop Applications in Sysexts

Sysexts can ship GUI applications (`.desktop` entry + icon), but icon visibility
has a trap that made every sysext app show GNOME's generic gear icon until
2026-07-07 (root-caused on the emdash sysext).

**Root cause — the hicolor icon cache is a validity-gated singleton.** GTK 3/4,
GNOME Shell (St's icon theme is a fork of GTK's), and Qt all read
`/usr/share/icons/hicolor/icon-theme.cache` and treat it as an *authoritative
index of the entire theme directory* whenever the cache file's mtime is >= the
theme directory's mtime. The base image ships a cache generated by the
`gtk-update-icon-cache` dpkg trigger at image build time. A merged sysext adds
icon files with their upstream timestamps — typically *older* than the image
build — so the merged `hicolor/` directory mtime (overlayfs surfaces the
topmost layer's dir mtime) stays older than the cache. The cache remains
"valid", the toolkit never readdirs the theme, and every icon not present at
image build time is invisible. Verified by differential test: an identical
copy of the merged tree fails `has_icon('emdash')` with the cache present and
succeeds the moment the cache is stale or absent.

**The pattern (both halves mandatory):**

1. **Images ship NO hicolor cache.** The shared image finalize
   (`shared/outformat/image/finalize/mkosi.finalize.chroot`) deletes
   `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/icon-theme.cache`. With no cache, toolkits scan
   the theme directories and find base *and* sysext icons. Only hicolor is
   stripped — named themes (Adwaita, …) never gain icons at runtime, so their
   caches stay valid and keep their startup benefit.
2. **Sysexts ship NO hicolor cache either.** Every sysext lists
   `shared/sysext/finalize/sysext-strip-icon-cache.sh` in `FinalizeScripts=`.
   If a sysext package pulls in icons, the dpkg trigger regenerates the cache
   inside the merged buildroot and the file lands in the sysext DELTA — a
   snapshot of base + this sysext's icons at build time. Merged on a host, that
   copy shadows the theme's cache for the whole `/usr` overlay and masks other
   sysexts' icons and any base icons newer than this sysext's build. This
   applies equally to sysexts built in other repositories: never
   ship `usr/share/icons/**/icon-theme.cache` in a sysext.

**Icon placement notes:**

- `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/<size>/apps/<icon>.png` (or `scalable/apps/*.svg`)
  is the spec-correct location and works under this pattern.
- `/usr/share/pixmaps/` (VS Code puts `vscode.png` there) is the unthemed
  fallback path — always scanned, never covered by any cache, so it works even
  on images that predate the fix. Not a reason to prefer it: single size, last
  in lookup order.
- A running GNOME Shell may not notice icons from a sysext merged mid-session
  (theme rescan is gated on directory mtimes); icons are reliably present from
  the next session start. The `.desktop` entry itself appears without a cache
  concern — GIO scans `/usr/share/applications` directly.
- Related caches with the same shadow-the-singleton failure shape to keep in
  mind for future desktop sysexts: `/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache`
  and `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled`. These are NOT stripped
  today — absence has real costs (GIO needs mimeinfo.cache for MIME→app
  lookups; GSettings requires compiled schemas) — but a sysext shipping its
  own copy of either will mask newer base state the same way the icon cache
  did. Evaluate per sysext.

## Adding a New Sysext

1. Create `mkosi.images/<name>/mkosi.conf` following the pattern above
2. Set `KEYPACKAGE` to the primary package name
3. Create `mkosi.images/<name>/required-paths.txt` listing the paths that prove the sysext is complete (main binaries, dependency payload, unit files, activation drop-in); the shared finalize check fails the build without it
4. Add any extra files in `mkosi.images/<name>/mkosi.extra/`
5. If configs needed in `/etc`: create `mkosi.finalize` to capture ONLY the needed paths to `/usr/share/factory/etc/` (never all of `/etc` — see Constraints), add tmpfiles.d rules
6. Create `<name>.transfer` and `<name>.feature` in `mkosi.images/base/mkosi.extra/usr/lib/sysupdate.d/`
7. **If the sysext ships a systemd service:** add `usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.d/10-<name>.conf` with `Upholds=<name>.service` (see [Service Activation Pattern](#service-activation-pattern-upholds) above)
8. **If the sysext ships a desktop application:** include `sysext-strip-icon-cache.sh` in `FinalizeScripts=` (all sysexts do, per the template) and list the `.desktop` file and icon in `required-paths.txt` (see [Desktop Applications in Sysexts](#desktop-applications-in-sysexts) above)
9. Add the sysext name to root `mkosi.conf` Dependencies list
10. Add a corresponding update check to `.github/workflows/check-dependencies.yml` if it has external downloads

For runtime setup scripts and units shipped inside `mkosi.extra/`, do not call `systemctl enable`, `systemctl disable`, `systemctl preset`, or remove shipped paths under `/etc` from the running guest. These mutate the live `/etc` overlay and can break bootc's `/etc` merge when a staged deployment finalizes. Express service state through presets/drop-ins at build time, and use `/var` marker files for run-once behavior.
